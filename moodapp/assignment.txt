# Phase one
Make an app that has a frontend that pushes data to a file managed by the backend. The frontend should take:
- Phrase
- Sentiment ( positive/negative )
The backend should save this to a file of your choice. This should all happen through AJAX requests. No page reloads!

# Phase 2
Create a module that uses bayesian machine learning to classify your Phrase as Sentiment. Basically the code should train the bayes algorithm to classify the input sentence as the 'sentiment' input.

For example phrase "you are awesome" as sentiment "positive"

The classification data should be saved progressively to another json file. For example 'learnings.json' or somesuch.

# Phase 3
Add a second page to your frontend where you can input a phrase. Through AJAX query your server to let the bayes algorithm classify this phrase. Then show the resulting sentiment in the page.

# Phase 4
Draw data from the twitter API and list it on one of your pages. Allow your visitor to classify twitter posts according to sentiment. Store this data in your learnings.


## Notes
Be sure to load your old bayes date when you reload your app.js
